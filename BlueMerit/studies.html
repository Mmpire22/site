                                        Turkey is an attraction to everyone in the world because of the spiritual and physical 
                                        features which are unique to each single city. <br><br>

                                        For example, İstanbul is the only city in the world that connects two continents. <br><br>

                                        The city, which is located in both Asia and Europe, has been the capital city 
                                        for many civilizations for thousands of years throughout its history. <br><br>

                                        The Turkish government is easing students’ lives by simplifying visa and resident permit 
                                        procedures. Unlike before, Resident permit applications are now submitted throughout 
                                        universities directly to migration offices.

                                        Turkey has enormous Turkish companies that welcome interns and international students.
                                        There are a lot of job opportunities in the Turkish market for foreigners in both 
                                        Turkish and international companies. <br><br>

                                                            Spain, but whilst living in the country you will definitely learn a massive amount of 
                                                            the Spanish language and a beautiful language it is! Just behind English, Spanish is the 
                                                            second most commonly spoken language in the world. It is always so much fun to learn a 
                                                            new language and there is no better way to learn a language than whilst you are among 
                                                            the people who speak it every day. As you attend university in Spain you will be mixing 
                                                            with those speaking the language and before you know it, you will be speaking it 
                                                            naturally as well.

                                                            Expected Cost: The cost of a bachelor’s degree at public universities in Spain will vary between 
                                                            680€ and 1,280€ each academic year, whilst the cost of private universities will be 
                                                            between 5,335€ and 15,000€ per academic year. The cost will always depend on the degree 
                                                            and university you opt for. On average, living in Spain will cost approximately 900 to

                                                            is definitely one of the cheapest European countries to live in, with the prices for
